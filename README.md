# compe260-binary-search-tree

## Description 
This program constructs a binary search tree. Once the tree is constructed three different traversals (Inorder, Preorder, & Postorder) will be performed to determine order of the tree nodes.

## How to use
The user enters any amount of elements they wish to include in the binary search tree. Once the desired number of elements are reached, the user presses '000' to initiate the traversal process. Afterwards the results of the three traversals are displayed.
